Allows manual selection of a 'main' category for each post for better permalinks and SEO.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to select a 'main' category for your posts, for better permalinks and SEO. It uses the same meta data as the "Hikari Category Permalink" and the "sCategory Permalink", but it has been rewritten using better and cleaner code. 
	
The chosen category is shown in bold on the 'Posts List' page and the 'Post Edit' page. You can select a different permalink category on the 'Post Edit' page using the 'Categories' box (hover over the categories and click on 'Permalink' to select one, then save your post).

Languages: English, French.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-category-permalink.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Upgrade Notice ==

Simply replace `wp-category-permalink.php` by the new one.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I donated, can I get rid of the donation button? =
Of course. I don't like to see too many of those buttons neither ;) You can disable the donation buttons from all my plugins by adding this to your wp-config.php:
`define('WP_HIDE_DONATION_BUTTONS', true);`

= Can I contact you? =
Yes, sure, you can! But since my plugins got popular, I get many emails everyday which consume almost 10% of my whole lifetime (not kidding! + it's rarely issues coming from the plugin itself). So now I ask you to visit my website <a href='http://www.totorotimes.com'>Totoro Times</a>, pick a page you like, and share it on Facebook, Twitter or your own website. I hope you understand :) Thanks a lot!
