Allows manual selection of a 'main' category for each post and WooCommerce product for better permalinks and SEO.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to select a main category for your posts for better permalinks and SEO. It uses the same meta data as the "Hikari Category Permalink" and the "sCategory Permalink", but it has been rewritten using better and cleaner code. 
	
The chosen category is shown in bold on the 'Posts List' page and the 'Post Edit' page. You can select a different permalink category on the 'Post Edit' page using the 'Categories' box (hover over the categories and click on 'Permalink' to select one, then save your post).

This plugin can also support WooCommerce products in its Pro version (unlocked through a serial). For more information about the Pro version, please visit the official page of the plugin here: http://apps.meow.fr/wp-category-permalink/.

Languages: English, French.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-category-permalink.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I donated, can I get rid of the donation button? =
Of course. I don't like to see too many of those buttons neither ;) You can disable the donation buttons from all my plugins by adding this to your wp-config.php:
`define('WP_HIDE_DONATION_BUTTONS', true);`

= Can I contact you? =
Yes, sure, you can! But since my plugins got popular, I get many emails everyday which consume almost 10% of my whole lifetime (not kidding! + it's rarely issues coming from the plugin itself). So now I ask you to visit my website <a href='http://www.totorotimes.com'>Totoro Times</a>, pick a page you like, and share it on Facebook, Twitter or your own website. I hope you understand :) Thanks a lot!
